      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a MERN Stack developer with a focus on building performant, secure,
        and accessible web applications. I enjoy turning ideas into polished
        products by combining React for the frontend with Node.js, Express,
        and MongoDB on the backend.
      </p>

      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Frontend: React,React-Native,HTML</li>
        <li>Backend: Node.js, Express, Python</li>
        <li>Database: MongoDB, MySQL</li>
        <li>CSS: Modern CSS,Bootstrap</li>
        <li>Tooling: Vite, Git</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Experience</h3>
      <p>
        I have built and shipped multiple full-stack projects — from small CRUD
        apps to larger single-page applications with authentication, file
        uploads, and third-party integrations. I prioritize clean code,
        performance, and developer experience.
